# Assembler
This is an assembler written in C (C90 to be precise) as a final assignment in the course System Programming Lab (מעבדה בתכנות מערכות) taken in the second semester of 2017 as a part of my B.Sc. in mathematics and computer science.
This received the max score of 100.
This assembler uses two passes to process the input – In the first passage we find all the variable and similar things and allocate the memory for them, in the second passage we encode the instructions.
Note: This project does not contain a tlinker.
